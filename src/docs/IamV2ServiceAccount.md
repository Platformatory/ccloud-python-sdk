# IamV2ServiceAccount

`ServiceAccount` objects are typically used to represent applications and other non-human principals that may access your Confluent resources.  The API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete individual service accounts, as well as list all your service accounts.   Related guide: [Service Accounts in Confluent Cloud](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/access-management/service-account.html).  ## The Service Accounts Model <SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/iam.v2.ServiceAccount\" />  ## Quotas and Limits This resource is subject to the [following quotas](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/quotas/overview.html):  | Quota | Description | | --- | --- | | `service_accounts_per_org` | Service Accounts in one Confluent Cloud organization |

## Properties
